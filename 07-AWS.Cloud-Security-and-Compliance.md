## S3 Bucket – Cloud Security and Compliance

In this activity, I configured an Amazon S3 bucket to host a static web application and applied proper access
control policies. This exercise demonstrates cloud governance, IAM permissions, and compliance validation
in AWS environments.

Learning how a simple misconfiguration can expose sensitive data is essential for GRC specialists to understand: the risk of public access, poor IAM practices, inadequate encryption, and insufficient logging and monitoring.
